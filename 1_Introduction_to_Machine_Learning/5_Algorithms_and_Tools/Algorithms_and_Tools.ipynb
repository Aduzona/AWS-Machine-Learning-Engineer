Your product manager tasked you with coming up with a new baseline model to predict the number of expected rides booked each day for the next 30 days. They provide you with a year's worth of previous data to build your predictive model. You decide to build a linear regression model first. What reason would you give to your product manager for choosing a linear regression model over their request to build a super sophisticated deep learning model?\n",
