    "\n",
    "Your company XYZ Inc has sales metrics for several clients' restaurants. The client sends over a CSV file from each restaurant with data that has a header file of name,food_item,date_of_sale,item_cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name: string\n",
    "* food_item: string\n",
    "* date_of_sale: date type, example 2021-01-01\n",
    "* item_cost: float\n",
    "\n",
    "After combining the data together, you are asked to take the combined dataset and transform some of the fields into additional data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the transformations you can do with the data provided?\n",
    "  * Transform the date_of_sale field into separate month,day and hour fields.\n",
    "  * Transform the food_item field with one-hot encoding\n",
    "  * Normalize the item_cost field.\n",
    "* Data summary tables often provide a range of values for each feature in your dataset. These may include but are not limited to: min and max values, mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles. Select an outcome that could happen based on a data summary table.\n",
    "  * Sometimes if you see min or max values that are in extreme ranges from the mean, there may be a few data points that are outliers.\n",

    "In this exercise, we applied a histogram and table summary visualization to our dataset. But this isn't the only visualization we could have applied to the data.\n",

    "**QUESTION 1 OF 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of task would you create to solve this data labeling issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Company XYZ Co. ships different types of containers all across the world, and would like to know how many are moved onto ships every hour. They have thousands of hours of video each day from workers loading the containers but need annotators to label which container is which in the video. They can use this data to eventually train a model to identify them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Video object detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION 2 OF 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some of the benefits of using Ground Truth for annotating your dataset?\n",
    "* Ability to create a pipeline for labelling your data of text, images, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce annotation costs by assisting human annotators using automatic data labeling through AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use mechanical turk, private, or vendors to source the annotation jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Annotate? 3 of 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we annotate data? Write down a few sentences on why it is so important for training models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your reflection*\n",
    "\n",
    "We annotate data so that we can create a model that can associate labels with given features it sees. The annotated data provides experience for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Things to think about*\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome job! Any answer will do, but mainly driving home the fact that without highly accurate labeled data, models will perform subpar if not terribly on real-world data.\n",
